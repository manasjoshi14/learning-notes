## Introduction

Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. This guide will help you navigate its C codebase, understand the key implementation details, and progressively build your knowledge from fundamentals to advanced components.

## 1. High-Level Architecture

Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. At its core, Redis is a server that processes commands sent by clients over a network connection. Here's how the major components fit together:

### Core Components

- **Event Loop (`src/ae.c`, `src/ae.h`)**: Redis uses an event-driven architecture that handles I/O events, timers, and signal handling through a unified event loop. This is the heart of Redis's single-threaded design. [^1]

- **Data Structures**:
  - Redis implements several specialized data structures (strings, lists, sets, sorted sets, hashes, streams, etc.)
  - Each data type has its own implementation file: `src/t_string.c`, `src/t_list.c`, `src/t_hash.c`, `src/t_set.c`, `src/t_zset.c`, `src/t_stream.c` [^2]

- **Memory Management (`src/zmalloc.c`, `src/zmalloc.h`)**: Custom memory allocator that tracks memory usage and can use different back-end allocators (jemalloc, tcmalloc, etc.) [^3]

- **Database (`src/db.c`)**: Handles the key-space and operations on keys like expiry, eviction, etc. A Redis database is represented by the `redisDb` structure defined in `src/server.h` [^4]

- **Networking (`src/networking.c`)**: Manages client connections, parsing the Redis protocol (RESP), and sending responses [^5]

- **Commands (`src/server.c`, `src/commands.c`)**: Command table and execution logic that processes client requests [^6]

- **Persistence**:
  - RDB (`src/rdb.c`): Point-in-time snapshots of the dataset
  - AOF (`src/aof.c`): Append-only file that logs every write operation [^7]

- **Replication (`src/replication.c`)**: Master-replica synchronization mechanism [^8]

- **Cluster (`src/cluster.c`)**: Redis Cluster implementation for distributed operation [^9]

### Communication Flow

1. Client connects to Redis server via TCP/IP or Unix socket
2. Server accepts connection through event loop (`connAcceptHandler` in `src/networking.c`) [^10]
3. Client sends command in Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP)
4. Server parses command (`processInputBuffer` in `src/networking.c`), executes it on the data structures [^11]
5. Server formats and sends response back to client (`addReply` functions in `src/networking.c`) [^12]

## 2. Implementation Deep Dives

### Server Initialization & Event Loop
Redis starts by initializing its configuration and setting up the event loop. The entry point is in `src/server.c`, which calls key initialization functions and then kicks off the main event loop that powers Redis's single-threaded design. Understanding this flow is essential as it forms the foundation of Redis's architecture. [^13]

- [Redis Server Initialization Guide](deep-dives/server_initialization.md)
- [Understanding the Redis Event Loop](deep-dives/redis_event_loop.md) (coming soon)
- [Client Connection Handling Flow](deep-dives/client_connections.md) (coming soon)
- [Signal Handling & Graceful Shutdown](deep-dives/signal_handling.md) (coming soon)

### Data Representation
All data in Redis is represented through a common object system defined in `src/server.h`. Redis uses a smart encoding system to minimize memory usage while maintaining performance, choosing different internal representations based on the data size and content. [^14]

- [Redis Object System Explained](deep-dives/redis_objects.md) (coming soon)
- [String Encoding Internals](deep-dives/string_encoding.md) (coming soon)
- [Redis Memory Layout](deep-dives/memory_layout.md) (coming soon)
- [Reference Counting & Memory Management](deep-dives/reference_counting.md) (coming soon)

### Core Data Structures
Redis implements several core data structures that power its commands. Each has specialized encodings for different use cases, with optimizations for memory efficiency and performance. The implementation typically starts simple for small data sets and switches to more complex structures as data grows. [^15]

- [String Implementation Guide](deep-dives/string_implementation.md)
- [List & Quicklist Implementation](deep-dives/quicklist.md) (coming soon)
- [Hash Tables & Ziplist Encoding](deep-dives/hash_implementation.md) (coming soon)
- [Sets Implementation](deep-dives/sets_implementation.md) (coming soon)
- [Sorted Sets & Skip Lists](deep-dives/zsets_implementation.md) (coming soon)
- [Streams Data Structure](deep-dives/streams_implementation.md) (coming soon)

### Command Processing
When a client sends a command, Redis needs to parse it, validate it, execute it, and send the response. The command table maps command names to functions, and the execution path involves several steps from protocol parsing to actual data manipulation. [^16]

- [Redis Protocol (RESP) Parser](deep-dives/resp_protocol.md) (coming soon)
- [Command Table Architecture](deep-dives/command_table.md) (coming soon)
- [Client Request Flow](deep-dives/client_request_flow.md) (coming soon)

### Configuration System
Redis uses a sophisticated configuration system that supports runtime changes, inheritance, and includes various safeguards. Understanding how Redis processes configuration directives is important for customizing and administering Redis instances. [^17]

- [Dynamic Configuration](deep-dives/dynamic_config.md) (coming soon)
- [Security Settings](deep-dives/security_settings.md) (coming soon)

### Persistence Mechanisms
Redis provides two complementary persistence mechanisms: RDB snapshots for point-in-time backups and AOF logs for complete command history. Understanding how these mechanisms work and interact is crucial for data durability in Redis. [^18]

- [Redis Persistence Tradeoffs](deep-dives/persistence_tradeoffs.md) (coming soon)
- [Background Saving Processes](deep-dives/background_saving.md) (coming soon)

### Advanced Features
Redis extends beyond basic data structures with features like replication for high availability, cluster for horizontal scaling, transactions for atomic operations, and pub/sub for message delivery. These features build on the core architecture while adding specialized components. [^19]

- [Pub/Sub Architecture](deep-dives/pubsub.md) (coming soon)
- [Keyspace Notifications](deep-dives/keyspace_notifications.md) (coming soon)
- [ACL System](deep-dives/acl_system.md) (coming soon)

### Extensions & Scripting
Redis can be extended through modules and Lua scripts, providing powerful ways to customize its behavior and implement complex operations atomically. [^20]

- [Lua Scripting Implementation](deep-dives/lua_scripting.md) (coming soon)
- [Function Loading & Execution](deep-dives/function_system.md) (coming soon)

### Memory Management & Optimization
Redis is designed to be memory-efficient, with several techniques to minimize overhead. It includes a custom memory allocator, intelligent eviction policies for when memory limits are reached, and various optimizations to maximize throughput with minimal memory usage. [^21]
