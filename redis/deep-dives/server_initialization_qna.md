# Redis Server Initialization Q&A

This document records questions and answers about server initialization, based on questions and doubts raised by the user while exploring the concept. These Q&A sessions supplement the main README documentation and provide deeper insights into specific aspects.

## What is size_t?

**Q: What is _size_t?**

**A:** `size_t` is an unsigned integer type defined in C/C++ that's used to represent the size of objects in memory. It's commonly used for:

- Array indexing
- Representing memory sizes and counts
- Return value for the `sizeof` operator
- Argument type for memory allocation functions like `malloc`

In macOS, `size_t` is typedefed as `__darwin_size_t`, which is a platform-specific implementation detail. The size of `size_t` is architecture-dependent: it's typically 4 bytes on 32-bit systems and 8 bytes on 64-bit systems, ensuring it can represent the maximum size an object can have on that platform.

In Redis server code, `size_t` is frequently used when dealing with memory allocation, string lengths, and array sizes.

## What does the random number initialization code do?

**Q: I'm bit rusty with C. Can you tell me what this code block is doing?**

```c
gettimeofday(&tv,NULL);
srand(time(NULL)^getpid()^tv.tv_usec);
srandom(time(NULL)^getpid()^tv.tv_usec);
init_genrand64(((long long) tv.tv_sec * 1000000 + tv.tv_usec) ^ getpid());
crc64_init();
```

**A:** This code block initializes random number generation and CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) tables during Redis server startup:

1. `gettimeofday(&tv,NULL)` - Gets the current time with microsecond precision and stores it in the `tv` struct (of type `struct timeval`).

2. `srand(time(NULL)^getpid()^tv.tv_usec)` - Seeds the standard C library random number generator with a value created by XORing (`^`):
   - Current time in seconds (`time(NULL)`)
   - Process ID (`getpid()`)
   - Microseconds component of current time (`tv.tv_usec`)

3. `srandom(time(NULL)^getpid()^tv.tv_usec)` - Seeds another random number generator (BSD's `random()` function) with the same seed value.

4. `init_genrand64(((long long) tv.tv_sec * 1000000 + tv.tv_usec) ^ getpid())` - Seeds a custom 64-bit random number generator (likely a Mersenne Twister implementation) with a value derived from:
   - Seconds and microseconds combined into one number
   - XORed with the process ID

5. `crc64_init()` - Initializes the CRC-64 lookup tables used for hash functions and data integrity checks.

This randomization is crucial for Redis security and proper functioning, as it's used for:
- Hash seed generation
- Keys for probabilistic data structures
- Timing randomization to prevent attacks
- Various internal operations that require unpredictability

Using both the current time (down to microseconds) and process ID helps ensure that different Redis instances, even if started very close to each other in time, will have different random sequences.
