## Introduction to Redis Strings

Redis strings are the most basic data type in Redis and can store text, integers, binary data, or serialized objects. Unlike many other programming languages, Redis implements its own string library called SDS (Simple Dynamic String) rather than using the C language's native strings. This custom implementation offers several advantages for Redis's use case:

- Binary safety (strings can contain any binary data, not just text) [src/sds.c:80-81](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L80-L81)
- Constant-time length operations (O(1) length retrieval) [src/sds.h:59-72](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L59-L72)
- Efficiency in prepending/appending operations [src/sds.c:467-476](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L467-L476)
- Memory optimization with different encoding strategies [src/object.c:611-667](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/object.c#L611-L667)
- Prevention of buffer overflows [src/sds.c:221-277](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L221-L277)
- Reduced memory reallocations through capacity management [src/sds.c:241-247](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L241-L247)

In the following sections, we'll explore how Redis implements these strings and the clever optimizations it uses to make them both memory-efficient and performant.

## SDS (Simple Dynamic String)

Redis's SDS (Simple Dynamic String) is a custom string type designed specifically for Redis's needs. The SDS library solves several limitations of C strings:

1. **O(1) length operations**: SDS stores the string length explicitly, so retrieving string length is a constant-time operation, unlike C strings which require O(n) time to compute length with `strlen()`. [src/sds.h:59-72](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L59-L72)

2. **Binary safety**: SDS can store any binary data, including null bytes (`\0`), while C strings use null bytes as terminators, making them unsuitable for binary data. [src/sds.c:80-81](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L80-L81)

3. **Reduced reallocation**: SDS implements a pre-allocation strategy that reduces the frequency of memory reallocation when appending to strings. [src/sds.c:221-277](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L221-L277)

4. **Memory efficiency**: SDS uses different header sizes for different string lengths, optimizing memory usage. [src/sds.h:23-44](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L23-L44)

5. **Safety against buffer overflows**: Operations like concatenation automatically check and allocate necessary space. [src/sds.c:467-476](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L467-L476)

6. **Compatibility with C functions**: Despite these differences, SDS strings are still null-terminated and can be passed to C functions expecting C strings. [src/sds.c:106-107](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L106-L107)

### SDS Types

Redis defines multiple SDS header types based on the string length, optimizing memory usage [src/sds.h:23-44](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L23-L44):

- `sdshdr5`: For very small strings (up to 31 bytes), stores length in the header flags. Note that the code comment indicates this type is never actually used directly [src/sds.h:23-26](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L23-L24).
- `sdshdr8`: For strings up to 255 bytes [src/sds.h:27-31](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L27-L31)
- `sdshdr16`: For strings up to 65,535 bytes [src/sds.h:32-36](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L32-L36)
- `sdshdr32`: For strings up to 4,294,967,295 bytes [src/sds.h:37-41](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L37-L41)
- `sdshdr64`: For extremely large strings (up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 bytes) [src/sds.h:42-46](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L42-L46)

The header type is chosen based on the string length during creation [src/sds.c:45-58](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L45-L58), and Redis automatically handles type conversions when strings grow [src/sds.c:254-271](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L254-L271).

## Key Files

The SDS implementation spans a few key files in the Redis codebase:

1. **src/sds.h**: Defines the SDS data structure and its API functions
   - Contains struct definitions for various SDS header types [src/sds.h:23-46](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L23-L46)
   - Defines inline utility functions for length, available space, etc. [src/sds.h:59-164](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L59-L164)
   - Declares all SDS manipulation functions [src/sds.h:166-264](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L166-L264)

2. **src/sds.c**: Implements the SDS API functions
   - String creation, duplication, and freeing [src/sds.c:80-177](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L80-L177)
   - String manipulation (concatenation, trimming, etc.) [src/sds.c:467-476](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L467-L476)
   - Memory allocation and reallocation strategies [src/sds.c:221-277](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L221-L277)
   - Various utility functions for string operations

3. **src/sdsalloc.h**: Provides memory allocation interfaces for SDS
   - Abstracts memory allocation to support different allocators [src/sds.h:260-264](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L260-L264)

The SDS implementation is completely self-contained and can be used independently of Redis, making it a versatile string library for any C project.

## String Structure

The SDS string type in Redis has a unique structure designed for flexibility and performance. At the API level, an SDS string is represented by a simple `char*` pointer [src/sds.h:16](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L16), which allows compatibility with C string functions. However, what makes it special is what lies before that pointer in memory.

### SDS Headers

Redis defines several header structures with varying sizes to optimize memory usage [src/sds.h:23-46](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L23-L46):

```c
struct __attribute__ ((__packed__)) sdshdr5 {
    unsigned char flags; /* 3 lsb of type, and 5 msb of string length */
    char buf[];
};
struct __attribute__ ((__packed__)) sdshdr8 {
    uint8_t len; /* used */
    uint8_t alloc; /* excluding the header and null terminator */
    unsigned char flags; /* 3 lsb of type, 5 unused bits */
    char buf[];
};
struct __attribute__ ((__packed__)) sdshdr16 {
    uint16_t len; /* used */
    uint16_t alloc; /* excluding the header and null terminator */
    unsigned char flags; /* 3 lsb of type, 5 unused bits */
    char buf[];
};
struct __attribute__ ((__packed__)) sdshdr32 {
    uint32_t len; /* used */
    uint32_t alloc; /* excluding the header and null terminator */
    unsigned char flags; /* 3 lsb of type, 5 unused bits */
    char buf[];
};
struct __attribute__ ((__packed__)) sdshdr64 {
    uint64_t len; /* used */
    uint64_t alloc; /* excluding the header and null terminator */
    unsigned char flags; /* 3 lsb of type, 5 unused bits */
    char buf[];
};
```

Each header contains:

1. **len**: The actual length of the string (how many bytes are currently being used)
2. **alloc**: The total allocated space for the string, excluding the header and the null terminator
3. **flags**: A byte containing the SDS type in the 3 least significant bits

The `sdshdr5` is special: instead of separate fields for length and allocation, it stores the string length directly in the flags byte (using 5 bits, hence the name). According to a code comment, this type is never actually used directly but is defined to document the layout [src/sds.h:23-24](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L23-L24).

The `__attribute__ ((__packed__))` ensures that the compiler doesn't add padding between struct fields, minimizing memory usage.

### The SDS Type

Redis defines an `sds` type as a simple alias for `char*` [src/sds.h:16](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L16):

```c
typedef char *sds;
```

This is the pointer that Redis functions work with, which points directly to the string content following the header.

### Type Constants

Redis defines constants to identify the different SDS types [src/sds.h:48-53](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L48-L53):

```c
#define SDS_TYPE_5  0
#define SDS_TYPE_8  1
#define SDS_TYPE_16 2
#define SDS_TYPE_32 3
#define SDS_TYPE_64 4
#define SDS_TYPE_MASK 7
#define SDS_TYPE_BITS 3
```

The type information is stored in the flags byte of the header and can be retrieved by masking with `SDS_TYPE_MASK`.

## Memory Layout

The memory layout of an SDS string is what makes it both efficient and compatible with C strings.

### Basic Layout

The memory layout of an SDS string follows this pattern [based on src/sds.c:80-107](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L80-L107):

```
+----------------+-------------------+------------------+---+
| SDS Header     | Actual string     | Unused space     | \0 |
| (metadata)     | (used content)    | (free/available) |    |
+----------------+-------------------+------------------+---+
^                ^
|                |
+--- sh          +--- s (returned to the user)
```

Where:
- `sh` is the header structure (one of the sdshdr types)
- `s` is the pointer returned to users, which points directly to the string content
- The string is always null-terminated, even if it contains binary data [src/sds.c:106-107](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L106-L107)

<!-- ðŸ”– BOOKMARK: Reading progress - Reached here -->

### Access Pattern

The pointer arithmetic to access the header and string components is handled through macros [src/sds.h:54-56](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L54-L56):

```c
#define SDS_HDR_VAR(T,s) struct sdshdr##T *sh = (void*)((s)-(sizeof(struct sdshdr##T)));
#define SDS_HDR(T,s) ((struct sdshdr##T *)((s)-(sizeof(struct sdshdr##T))))
```

These macros help navigate the memory layout by calculating the appropriate offsets based on the SDS type.

### Example

Let's see how this works in practice for an `sdshdr8` string containing "hello":

```
Memory address:  0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8       9       10      11
                +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
Content:        |   5   |   9   |   1   |   h   |   e   |   l   |   l   |   o   |  \0   |       |       |       |
                +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
                    ^       ^       ^       ^
                    |       |       |       |
                    |       |       |       +-- s (returned to the user as the SDS string)
                    |       |       |
                    |       |       +-- flags (SDS_TYPE_8)
                    |       |
                    |       +-- alloc (9 bytes allocated, excluding header and null terminator)
                    |
                    +-- len (5 bytes used, the length of "hello")
```

In this example:
- The header starts at address 0
- The user's `sds` pointer points to address 3, where the actual string content begins
- The string is 5 bytes long but has space for 9 bytes before reallocation is needed
- The string is null-terminated, even though SDS tracks length explicitly

This layout is critical to understanding how SDS achieves its advantages over standard C strings, particularly in performance and memory efficiency.

## String Commands

Redis string commands are implemented in the `src/t_string.c` file. These commands build upon the SDS library and provide the API that Redis clients interact with. Let's examine the key aspects of how Redis implements these commands:

### Dual Encoding Strategy

Redis uses a sophisticated dual encoding system for string values [src/object.c:611-667](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/object.c#L611-L667):

1. **Integer encoding**: When a string contains only a valid 64-bit signed integer, Redis may store it directly as a `long long` instead of as an SDS string. This is called "int" encoding [src/object.c:631-651](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/object.c#L631-L651).

2. **SDS encoding**: For all other cases, Redis uses the SDS implementation we've explored. Redis further optimizes this with:
   - **RAW encoding**: Standard SDS strings [src/object.c:28](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/object.c#L28)
   - **EMBSTR encoding**: Embedded strings where the object and string are in a contiguous memory area [src/object.c:69-92](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/object.c#L69-L92)

This approach saves memory when storing numbers and optimizes certain operations on numeric values.

### Key String Commands

Let's look at how some of the most common string commands are implemented:

#### SET Command

The `setCommand` function handles the SET command, which stores a string value at the specified key [src/t_string.c:274-282](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/t_string.c#L274-L282):

```c
void setCommand(client *c) {
    robj *expire = NULL;
    int unit = UNIT_SECONDS;
    int flags = OBJ_NO_FLAGS;

    if (parseExtendedStringArgumentsOrReply(c,&flags,&unit,&expire,COMMAND_SET) != C_OK) {
        return;
    }

    c->argv[2] = tryObjectEncoding(c->argv[2]);
    setGenericCommand(c,flags,c->argv[1],c->argv[2],expire,unit,NULL,NULL);
}
```

The actual setting is handled by `setGenericCommand` [src/t_string.c:61-94](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/t_string.c#L61-L94) which:
1. Creates a string object from the value
2. Stores it in the database
3. Notifies clients monitoring the key
4. Updates statistics

#### GET Command

The `getCommand` retrieves the value of a key [src/t_string.c:311-313](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/t_string.c#L311-L313):

```c
void getCommand(client *c) {
    getGenericCommand(c);
}
```

The `getGenericCommand` function [src/t_string.c:298-309](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/t_string.c#L298-L309):
1. Looks up the key in the database
2. Verifies that the value is a string
3. Returns the value to the client

#### INCR/DECR Commands

The increment/decrement commands are implemented to work directly with the integer encoding. While not shown in the code snippet provided, these commands check if the value is already an integer encoding and perform the increment directly, or convert the string to a number, increment it, and store it back.

#### APPEND Command

The append command demonstrates the flexibility of the SDS library. It uses `sdscatlen` from the SDS library to append data efficiently and handles string conversion if the string was stored in a compact encoding.

### Redis Objects and SDS

In Redis, SDS strings are wrapped in Redis Objects (robj) defined in `server.h` [src/server.h:1001-1008](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/server.h#L1001-L1008):

```c
struct redisObject {
    unsigned type:4;        // Type (string, list, set, etc.)
    unsigned encoding:4;    // Storage method (raw, int, embstr)
    unsigned lru:LRU_BITS;  // LRU time or LFU data
    int refcount;           // Reference count
    void *ptr;              // Points to actual object data (SDS, etc.)
};
```

For string objects:
- `type` is set to `OBJ_STRING`
- `encoding` can be `OBJ_ENCODING_RAW` (normal SDS), `OBJ_ENCODING_INT` (integer), or `OBJ_ENCODING_EMBSTR` (embedded string) [src/server.h:973-989](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/server.h#L973-L989)
- `ptr` points to either an SDS string or a direct integer value

The string commands work with these Redis Objects rather than directly with SDS strings, adding a layer of abstraction that enables the multiple encoding strategies.

## Performance Optimizations

Redis implements several clever optimizations in its SDS string library to maximize performance and minimize memory usage:

### 1. Type-Based Memory Optimization

Redis uses different header types based on string length, which minimizes memory overhead [src/sds.c:45-58](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L45-L58):

- Very small strings use the compact `sdshdr5` format (in practice, this type is defined but not actively used - see comment in [src/sds.h:23-24](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L23-L24))
- Medium-sized strings use `sdshdr8` or `sdshdr16`
- Larger strings use `sdshdr32` or `sdshdr64`

This approach ensures that strings only carry the minimal overhead necessary for their size, saving significant memory when working with millions of small strings.

### 2. Pre-allocation Strategy

When growing strings through operations like concatenation, Redis employs a strategic pre-allocation algorithm to reduce the frequency of reallocation [src/sds.c:241-247](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L241-L247):

```c
if (greedy == 1) {
    if (newlen < SDS_MAX_PREALLOC)
        newlen *= 2;
    else
        newlen += SDS_MAX_PREALLOC;
}
```

The key insight here is:
- For small strings (< 1MB), Redis doubles the allocation
- For large strings (â‰¥ 1MB), Redis adds a fixed amount (1MB) [src/sds.h:14](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L14)

This approach reduces the amortized cost of many small appends, while still being memory-efficient with large strings.

### 3. Avoiding Header Reallocation

Redis's `sdshdr` structures include a flexible `buf[]` array at the end, which is a C99 feature allowing the header and string to be allocated in a single memory block. This approach [src/sds.h:23-46](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L23-L46):

- Eliminates the need for separate allocations
- Improves cache locality (the header and data are adjacent in memory)
- Reduces memory fragmentation

### 4. Lazy Free Space Reclamation

Redis doesn't automatically shrink strings when content is removed. This design choice avoids costly reallocations if the string grows again later [src/sds.c:221-277](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L221-L277).

### 5. Empty String Optimization

Creating empty strings is optimized to use `sdshdr8` rather than `sdshdr5`, anticipating that empty strings are often created for the purpose of appending data [src/sds.c:85-86](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L85-L86):

```c
/* Empty strings are usually created in order to append. Use type 8
 * since type 5 is not good at this. */
if (type == SDS_TYPE_5 && initlen == 0) type = SDS_TYPE_8;
```

### 6. Null Termination with Length Tracking

While SDS tracks string length explicitly for O(1) operations, it still null-terminates strings [src/sds.c:106-107](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L106-L107). This hybrid approach enables:

- Fast length queries without traversing the string
- Direct compatibility with C string library functions
- Binary safety despite the null terminator (since length is tracked separately)

## Common Operations

SDS provides a rich set of string manipulation operations, all designed for safety, efficiency, and ease of use:

### String Creation

```c
sds sdsnewlen(const void *init, size_t initlen) {
    /* Create a string with specific content and length */
}

sds sdsnew(const char *init) {
    /* Create a string from a C string */
}

sds sdsempty(void) {
    /* Create an empty string */
}

sds sdsdup(const sds s) {
    /* Duplicate an existing SDS string */
}
```

These functions are defined in [src/sds.c:80-172](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L80-L172).

### String Modification

```c
sds sdscatlen(sds s, const void *t, size_t len) {
    /* Append binary-safe data to the string */
}

sds sdscat(sds s, const char *t) {
    /* Append a C string */
}

sds sdscatsds(sds s, const sds t) {
    /* Append another SDS string */
}

sds sdscpylen(sds s, const char *t, size_t len) {
    /* Replace the string's content with new data */
}

void sdsrange(sds s, ssize_t start, ssize_t end) {
    /* Trim the string to contain only the specified range */
}
```

These operations are implemented in [src/sds.c:467-529](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L467-L529).

### String Information

```c
size_t sdslen(const sds s) {
    /* Get string length - O(1) operation */
}

size_t sdsavail(const sds s) {
    /* Get available space for growth without reallocation */
}

size_t sdsallocsize(sds s) {
    /* Get total allocated size including header */
}
```

These functions are defined as inline functions in [src/sds.h:59-127](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L59-L127).

### Memory Management

```c
void sdsfree(sds s) {
    /* Free an SDS string */
}

sds sdsMakeRoomFor(sds s, size_t addlen) {
    /* Ensure the string has space for growth */
}

sds sdsRemoveFreeSpace(sds s) {
    /* Trim excess allocation to save memory */
}
```

These memory management functions are found in [src/sds.c:178-304](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L178-L304).

### String Formatting

```c
sds sdscatprintf(sds s, const char *fmt, ...) {
    /* Append formatted output (printf style) */
}

sds sdscatfmt(sds s, char const *fmt, ...) {
    /* Append formatted output (custom format) */
}
```

String formatting functions can be found in [src/sds.c:608-716](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L608-L716).

### String Manipulation

```c
sds sdstrim(sds s, const char *cset) {
    /* Trim characters from the beginning and end */
}

void sdstolower(sds s) {
    /* Convert string to lowercase */
}

void sdstoupper(sds s) {
    /* Convert string to uppercase */
}

sds *sdssplitlen(const char *s, ssize_t len, const char *sep, int seplen, int *count) {
    /* Split string by separator */
}
```

These carefully designed operations form the foundation of Redis's efficient string handling, empowering the database's core functionality.

## Implementation Details

Redis's SDS implementation contains several interesting technical details that contribute to its effectiveness:

### 1. Flexible Array Member

The SDS headers use C99's flexible array members (`char buf[]`) to create variable-sized structures [src/sds.h:23-46](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L23-L46). This technique allows the header and string content to be allocated together in a single memory block, improving locality and reducing fragmentation.

```c
struct __attribute__ ((__packed__)) sdshdr8 {
    uint8_t len;
    uint8_t alloc;
    unsigned char flags;
    char buf[];  // Flexible array member
};
```

### 2. Pointer Arithmetic for Header Access

SDS strings use a clever approach to store metadata without requiring users to handle it explicitly. The SDS functions access the header by performing pointer arithmetic on the user-visible string pointer [src/sds.h:59-72](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L59-L72):

```c
static inline size_t sdslen(const sds s) {
    unsigned char flags = s[-1];
    switch(flags&SDS_TYPE_MASK) {
        case SDS_TYPE_5:
            return SDS_TYPE_5_LEN(flags);
        case SDS_TYPE_8:
            return SDS_HDR(8,s)->len;
        case SDS_TYPE_16:
            return SDS_HDR(16,s)->len;
        case SDS_TYPE_32:
            return SDS_HDR(32,s)->len;
        case SDS_TYPE_64:
            return SDS_HDR(64,s)->len;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

The `s[-1]` syntax accesses the byte just before the string pointer, which is where the flags byte is located. After determining the SDS type from the flags, the appropriate header can be accessed.

### 3. Type Detection and Dynamic Sizing

Redis detects which SDS header type to use based on the size of the string [src/sds.c:45-58](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L45-L58):

```c
static inline char sdsReqType(size_t string_size) {
    if (string_size < 1<<5)
        return SDS_TYPE_5;
    if (string_size < 1<<8)
        return SDS_TYPE_8;
    if (string_size < 1<<16)
        return SDS_TYPE_16;
#if (LONG_MAX == LLONG_MAX)
    if (string_size < 1ll<<32)
        return SDS_TYPE_32;
    return SDS_TYPE_64;
#else
    return SDS_TYPE_32;
#endif
}
```

This approach ensures that the smallest possible header type is used, minimizing memory overhead.

### 4. Platform-Specific Optimizations

Redis adjusts its SDS implementation based on the platform. For example, on 32-bit systems, `sdshdr64` might not be available [src/sds.c:52-58](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L52-L58):

```c
#if (LONG_MAX == LLONG_MAX)
    if (string_size < 1ll<<32)
        return SDS_TYPE_32;
    return SDS_TYPE_64;
#else
    return SDS_TYPE_32;
#endif
```

### 5. Memory Allocator Abstraction

The SDS implementation abstracts memory allocation through functions defined in `sdsalloc.h` [src/sds.h:260-264](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L260-L264):

```c
void *sds_malloc(size_t size);
void *sds_realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
void sds_free(void *ptr);
```

This abstraction allows Redis to use different memory allocators (like jemalloc, tcmalloc, or the standard libc allocator) with the SDS library.

### 6. Allocation Interface with Usable Length

Redis's memory allocation takes advantage of the actual allocated space [src/sds.c:90-92](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L90-L92):

```c
sh = trymalloc ? 
    s_trymalloc_usable(hdrlen+initlen+1, &usable) :
    s_malloc_usable(hdrlen+initlen+1, &usable);
```

By retrieving the "usable" size from the allocator, Redis can use any extra space provided by the allocator's block size alignment, improving memory efficiency.

## Benchmarks and Trade-offs

Redis's SDS implementation makes specific trade-offs that optimize for Redis's use cases:

### Performance Characteristics

1. **Memory Overhead**: The different header types introduce varying levels of overhead:
   - `sdshdr5`: 1 byte overhead
   - `sdshdr8`: 3 bytes overhead
   - `sdshdr16`: 5 bytes overhead
   - `sdshdr32`: 9 bytes overhead
   - `sdshdr64`: 17 bytes overhead

   This progressive scaling provides an excellent balance of efficiency for different string sizes.

2. **Operation Complexity**:
   - Length queries: O(1) [src/sds.h:59-72](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.h#L59-L72)
   - Append operations: Amortized O(1) [src/sds.c:467-476](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L467-L476)
   - Substring extraction: O(n) where n is the substring length
   - Split operations: O(n) where n is the string length

3. **Cache Locality**: By keeping the header and string data together, SDS strings have excellent cache locality, enhancing performance on modern CPUs.

### Trade-offs

1. **Memory vs. Speed**: Redis consciously trades some memory for speed. The pre-allocation strategy may use more memory than strictly necessary, but it reduces reallocation frequency, improving overall performance [src/sds.c:241-247](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/unstable/src/sds.c#L241-L247).

2. **Simplicity vs. Optimization**: Despite its optimizations, SDS maintains a relatively simple API. Redis could use even more complex structures (like rope data structures) for certain operations, but it favors simplicity and predictability.

3. **Abstraction Costs**: The pointer arithmetic and type detection add a small overhead to operations, but this is outweighed by the benefits of the unified API and memory efficiency.

4. **Specialized vs. General-Purpose**: SDS is highly optimized for Redis's specific use cases, which might make it less ideal for general-purpose string handling in other applications.

### Benchmark Insights

In Redis's own benchmarks (note: specific benchmark data is not present in the code, this section reflects general information about SDS performance characteristics that can be inferred from the implementation):

1. SDS consistently outperforms standard C strings for operations like concatenation and length queries.

2. The pre-allocation strategy shows its greatest benefits when performing many small appends to the same string.

3. The memory overhead of SDS is minimal compared to the total memory usage of typical Redis workloads.

4. The type-based optimization significantly reduces memory usage in real-world scenarios with many small strings.

These performance characteristics make SDS an excellent choice for Redis, where efficiency in both time and space is critical for handling large numbers of keys and values with varying sizes and operations.
